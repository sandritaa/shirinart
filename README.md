# MadalasArt

MadalasArt is a web application that allows for an artist to showcase and sell their artwork. As an artist, you can upload your art pieces to the web application using the Cloudinary API and sell them through your own personalized virtual gallery. You can also view all the orders you have in place and send order updates directly to your customerâ€™s inbox using the Twilio SendGrid API. As a customer, you can view the artist gallery and purchase a multiple items from the artist in one transaction. As a subscribed customer, you are also able to like different art pieces and keep track of your orders.

Once you are logged in as a customer you can browse around the artist gallery to admire the art and do some of the following things:

- Add items to the cart

You can then proceed to checkout by clicking on the cart and create new order(s) by entering your shipping, billing and payment details. Before proceeding to checkout, you still have the possibility to remove items from the cart if you change your mind. Note that the transaction is at this stage a fake transaction.

You can then click on profile and keep track of your previous orders, which artists you are following and which items you liked.

You can also shop if you are not logged in as a customer but you will not be able to like items and follow artists.

To run this web app on your local machine, follow these instructions.

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/sandritaa/galleriamilena.git
```

Create a virtual environment:

```
virtualenv env
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```
source env/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a file called `keys.py` at the top level and and get your [Twilio SendGrid API](https://sendgrid.com) keys. Then place your keys (`$API_KEY`) inside the file `keys.py`. The file should look as follows:

```
import os
os.environ['SENDGRID_KEY'] = '$API_KEY'
```

You can then create and seed the PostgreSQL database using some dummy data by running the following command:

```
python3 seeddb.py
```

```
python3 server.py
```
